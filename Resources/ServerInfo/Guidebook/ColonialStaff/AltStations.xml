  # STC Alternate Stations

# Changing Stations

As an STC you arent locked to your cage of Colossus Central, you can stretch your legs and expand your reach to other stations!

Trademall and Cargo Depot's are under Colonial jurisdiciton meaning with permission from your [color=#1b67a5]Overseer.[/color] you can get a small shuttle and fly over to them!

Be careful though, as these alternate locations are NOT safe zones, and some people might take it as an opprutinity to kill you for your [color=#1b67a5]Station Master Encryption Key[/color]!
