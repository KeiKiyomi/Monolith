  # Expanding and Repairing Shuttles or Stations
  In Colossus Sector, it is common for spacers or engineers to want to expand the stations or their shuttles, or repair holes left by meteors, combat, or a really angry Security shuttle

  ## Lattice
  Lattice is bare rodwork placed in empty space. It's used as a foundation for building and anchoring objects onto the station.

  You can create lattice by placing rods on empty space using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color]. Remember you can craft steel sheets into rods using the construction menu.

  Lattice cannot hold pressure, and all gasses will leak out into space through it.

  You can use wirecutters to remove lattice by using [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color] on them.

  If the game is preventing you from placing lattice, it's because there is another separated grid too close to the grid you're trying to expand. You can use a wirecutter to remove the offending grid.

  ## Hull Tiles
  Hull tiles are solid foundation for the station, where all the other parts of the station rest upon.

  Lattice can be made into hull tiles by using either steel or almost any type of floor tile on them by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="Use"][/bold][/color].
  This will convert the lattice into a hull tile, which can hold pressure and gasses.

  It is advised to use floor tiles to replace lattice instead of steel sheets, as you can craft 4 floor tiles from a single steel sheet.

  You can use an RCD to deconstruct hull tiles into lattice, or you can build hull tiles, walls, and glass using one.

  ## Ship Repair Device (SRD)

  SRD's can repair any damaged part of ships or stations, when bought from a [color=#f39f27]Engi-Vend[/color] or made from a Lathe and loaded with Ship Repair Matter (SRM) when used on a grid that is destroyed, or apart from a valid grid it will replace missing objects, tiles, and walls. It can even fix wiring, gas pipes, and gun systems! However some parts take more SRM to make.

  SRD's along with its ammo can be acquired through [color=#c96dbf]Researcing[/color] [color=#f39f27]Advanced Tools[/color] and then making it at a

You can make SRD ammo without research however it is more expensive then researching it and making it normally, you can acquire SRM at a
