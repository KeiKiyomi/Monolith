  # Wire Panels
  Some station devices like airlocks, vending machines, and arcade consoles have wire panels, which control certain aspects of their functionality.

  These panels can be opened using a screwdriver to access the wiring inside.

  From here you can use wirecutters and a multitool to interact with the wiring. Note that interacting with the wiring often requires insulated gloves (or those who are rated to protect againts shock, such as combat gloves), as if the wire is live, you can get shocked.

  You can cut and mend wires using the wirecutters and pulse wires using the multitool.

  Cutting wires often completely disables or restores functionality to a device if you mend the wire.
  It may also trigger unintended functionality like shocking people, dropping door bolts, or exploding the bomb!

  Pulsing wires can have a variety of effects, but oftentimes it either temporarily disables or enables functionality.

  You can't pulse wires if the wire you're trying to pulse is cut. You have to mend the wire first by using a wirecutter on the snipped wire.
