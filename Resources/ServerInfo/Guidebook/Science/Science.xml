# Science
[color=#c96dbf]Science[/color], often called Research and Development, is a job made up of both generating research points to unlock new technologies as well as using said technologies to produce new items at lathes to help out the sector.
  
## Technologies
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerResearchAndDevelopment"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ResearchAndDevelopmentServer"/>
  </Box>
The most important thing inside your ship or stations research section is the R&D server, which stores unlocked technologies, and the R&D computer, which allows you to unlock [color=#a4885c]technologies[/color].

Each technology costs [color=#a4885c]Research Points[/color] and unlocks recipes at lathes. Some technologies will also have prerequisites you have to unlock before you can research them.

## Alternate Servers

In order to do some research you need a different [color=#c96dbf]Research and Devlopment Server[/color] such as

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ResearchAndDevelopmentServerMerc"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ResearchAndDevelopmentServerRogues"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ResearchAndDevelopmentServerTSFMC"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ResearchAndDevelopmentServerUssp"/>
  </Box>

[textlink="Click here to see a list of technologies." link="Technologies"].

## Disciplines
Technologies are spread over 7 different Disciplines:
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Wrench" Caption="Industrial"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WeaponTetherGun" Caption="Experimental"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerTelevision" Caption="Civil Services"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WeaponXrayCannon" Caption="Arsenal"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BannerNfsd" Caption="TSFMC"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BannerYellow" Caption="PDV"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BannerRed" Caption="USSP"/>
  </Box>

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ComputerResearchAndDevelopment"/> Use your nearest R&D console to take note of which kind of research is locked behind each Discipline tree.

## Server Specific Tech
Some servers have access to different tree's, and you need to have that server selected in order to do research into that tree, for example USSP, PDV (Rogues), and TSFMC all have their own research tree's that can be accessed using their R&D server

TSFMC have their own lathe which is required to print researched TSFMC tech. USSP and PDV can print their tech using a 

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="FactionLathe"/>

## Lathes
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Autolathe"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Protolathe"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CircuitImprinter"/>
  </Box>
  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MedicalTechFab"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MercenaryTechFab"/>
  </Box>
At a lathe, you can choose a server to allow it print whatever recipes you have unlocked. Recipes require various materials (steel, glass, plastic, gold, plasma) which can be acquired from miners or salvagers.
