  DoC shift objectives:

  1) Ensure the health and well-being of Colossus Sector's people, no matter their species, alignment, or criminal status

  2) Foster collaboration and coordinate efforts of Emergency Responders where possible.

  3) Encourage medical mentorship, either personally, time permitting, or by finding appropriate placement for new Emergency Responders.

  4) Compensate medical teams for their work in assisting with the above three goals.

  ## Your Ledger

  To compensate medical teams and station staff you have been provided a discretionary fund.

  Colossus Command is prepared to provide additional resources for the successful return of each medical bounty.
